# Word Guesser
A genetic algorithm that works towards finding a word without knowing it. The problem is featured in Daniel Shiffman's ["The Nature of Code"](https://natureofcode.com). His [demonstrated solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jv3CgDN9sc) is written in JavaScript, but this implementation, loosely based on his, is written in C++.

## Compilation and Usage
1. Compile the project by running `make` in the project root directory.
2. The compiled executable will be in the `out` folder. Just run `./wordguesser` from inside that folder to start it.
